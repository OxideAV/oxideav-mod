## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `8xx` Set FINE Panning (FT extension): per-channel `pan: u8`
  (0 = hard LEFT, 255 = hard RIGHT) overwrites the Amiga LRRL
  hard-pan default. Cited in `Protracker-effects-MODFIL12.txt`
  lines 1201-1207.
- `E8x` Set ROUGH Panning (FT extension): per-channel pan from
  the nibble replicated into both halves of the byte (`E80` →
  0x00, `E8F` → 0xFF). Cited in `Protracker-effects-MODFIL12.txt`
  lines 1503-1505 and `multimedia-cx-protracker.html` E8x.
- New `pan_gains(p, s)` helper that derives per-channel L/R gains
  from the 8-bit pan and the global `pan_separation`. Collapses to
  the prior hard-LRRL formula at the endpoints (pan = 0 or 255)
  so the libmodplug-calibrated headroom divisor is preserved
  bit-for-bit on MODs that don't use 8xx / E8x. Centred channels
  (pan = 128) split evenly regardless of separation.
